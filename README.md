🌩️ AWS Infrastructure Deployment with Terraform
Automated Cloud Provisioning • Secure Architecture • Scalable & Modular IaC
Welcome to this repository!
This project is a complete, real‑world AWS Infrastructure Deployment, fully automated using Terraform, built inside GitHub Codespaces, and structured in a clean, modular, production‑ready format.

This README is written not just to document the project, but to tell the story of how the infrastructure comes alive — making it easy for recruiters, mentors, and teammates to quickly understand your architecture and workflow.

🚀 Project Overview
This project automates the deployment of a full AWS environment using Terraform.
It includes:

🏗 VPC with public & private subnets

🔒 Secure Routing via Internet Gateway & NAT Gateway

🛡 Security Groups for controlled inbound/outbound traffic

🖥️ EC2 instance hosted in a private or public subnet

🔧 User Data Bootstrapping

📦 Reusable Terraform Modules

📁 A clean file structure with .gitignore to prevent unnecessary uploads

Everything is designed with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles — meaning your infrastructure is predictable, repeatable, and easily version-controlled.

Why This Matters
💡 Industry standards expect modular Terraform.
This layout shows you understand professional IaC practices — which is a big plus for DevOps roles.

🌐 Architecture at a Glance
Your deployment creates a modern AWS infrastructure:

🛰 VPC Layer
Custom VPC

Public & private subnets

Route tables for controlled traffic

Internet Gateway for external communication

🔐 Security Layer
Security Groups allowing only intended traffic

No public exposure unless explicitly configured

💻 Compute Layer (EC2)
Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance

Automatically bootstrapped via user data

Can host a web server or any custom application

☁️ Why Terraform?
Terraform provides:

Immutable builds

Version-controlled infrastructure

Easy environment replication

Safety through execution plans (terraform plan)

⚙️ How to Run This Project
1️⃣ Initialize Terraform
terraform init
This downloads all required providers and sets up the state backend.

2️⃣ Validate Everything
terraform validate

3️⃣ Preview the Infrastructure
terraform plan
This shows exactly what Terraform will create.

4️⃣ Deploy to AWS
terraform apply -auto-approve
Terraform will now:

Create VPC

Create subnets

Configure route tables

Launch EC2

Apply security rules

All automatically.

5️⃣ Destroy the Infrastructure
When you're done:

terraform destroy -auto-approve
Terraform will clean up everything — keeping your AWS bill low! 💸

🧳 Best Practices Used
✔ .terraform/ removed from Git repo
✔ .gitignore added to prevent heavy files
✔ Modular structure
✔ No secrets stored in repo
✔ Reusable components
✔ Clean commit history

This shows strong DevOps engineering discipline.

🌟 What Makes This Project Special?
This is not a simple beginner-level Terraform setup.

This project demonstrates:

⭐ Real production-like AWS design

⭐ Ability to architect networks and compute resources

⭐ Clear understanding of Terraform modules

⭐ Version-controlled IaC

⭐ Skill in debugging GitHub push issues (large files, secrets)

⭐ Your ability to deploy and manage cloud environments independently

Perfect for:

DevOps portfolios

Cloud engineering interviews

Resume projects

Demonstrating Terraform mastery
